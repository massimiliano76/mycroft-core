# Build an Ubuntu-based container to run Mycroft
#
#   The steps in this build are ordered from least likely to change to most
#   likely to change.  The intent behind this is to reduce build time so things
#   like Jenkins jobs don't spend a lot of time re-building things that did not
#   change from one build to the next.
